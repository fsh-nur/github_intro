# GIT and GITHub

## Git is a version control system that allows developers to manage changes to their code over time - it was created by Linus Torvalds.

#### Git enables developers to:
- Track changes to their code
- Collaborate with other developers on the same code
- Maintain history of all changes to the code

## Using Git, developers can track changes to their code, collaborate with other developers on the same code, and maintain history of all changes to the code, even going back to previous versions. Git allows develops to create "branches" of code, which are seperate versions of a codebase that can be worked on independently and then "merged" together when changes are complete. 

# Github:

## Github is a web based platform which host Git repositories, as well as other collaboration tools for software development teams. On Github, developers can create repositories that hold their code, as well as amy associated files such as documentation, configuration files and other assets. These can be public, often used to showcase a portfolio of code for professional networking, or private, between specific collaborators. 

## Pull requests are one collaboration feature which Github offers, which is what allows developers to propose changes made to a database, and these changes can be merged. Issues are another collaboration tool which allow developers to discuss any bugs, or feature requests. 

# Main Git Commands:


`git add <filename>` or `git add`

### - Everything is added from the current location

` git commit -m "<message>"`

### - Files are comitted to git with a message to identify what changes are being made

`git push -u origin main`

### - Files are pushed to the github repository and changes to the code are now being tracked on github

`git log`

### - Lists all the commits that were made

`git pull`

### - Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch.
